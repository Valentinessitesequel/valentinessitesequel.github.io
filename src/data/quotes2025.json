But anyways you don't care about the nerd stuff. I just wanted to say that I love you, happy valentines day, and I hope I get to have you as my valentine for the rest of my life. Just like this website, our relationship will continue to change and evolve, but living with you has made me certain that I want to see it through. Is this website as needed now that I can tell you this all myself? Maybe not. But it is always nice for you to have a reminder. - Caleb"
